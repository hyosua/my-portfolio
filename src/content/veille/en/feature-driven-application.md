The article published on dev.to presents **Feature-Driven Architecture** as an approach to structure a frontend around **business features** rather than technical layers.<br><br>

The core idea: each **feature** is a **self-contained functional unit** (UI, logic, state, tests) with a **clear public API**, promoting **encapsulation** and **independent evolution**.<br><br>

This organization reduces **complexity**, **cognitive load**, and **fragile dependencies**, making the codebase more **scalable** (in terms of structure, not just performance).<br><br>

Combined with **Atomic Design**, it enables both **reusable UI components** and **autonomous features**, while improving **team collaboration** and **parallel development**.
