**react-best-practices** is a curated framework capturing **10+ years** of **React** and **Next.js** performance learnings, designed for **developers** and **AI coding agents**.<br /><br />

It focuses on fixing **high-impact performance issues first**, especially:
- **Eliminating async waterfalls**
- **Reducing JavaScript bundle size**
- **Preventing unnecessary re-renders**<br /><br />

The core principle is **ordering by impact** — fixing **waiting time** and **over-shipped code** matters more than micro-optimizations.<br /><br />

The repository includes **40+ rules** across **8 categories**, each with:
- **Impact ratings** (CRITICAL → LOW)
- **Concrete code examples**
- A compiled **AGENTS.md** for consistent **AI-driven refactors**<br /><br />

The practices come from **real production fixes** and are packaged as **Agent Skills** for tools like **Cursor**, **Codex**, and **Claude Code**.<br /><br />

**Goal:** reduce long-term performance debt and improve real-world React metrics at scale.<br /><br />
